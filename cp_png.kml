			<name>Grant&apos;s Tent</name>
			<description><![CDATA[General Grant’s Headquarters at during summer 1864 was in the yard of the Eppes Plantation House in City Point. It was not until November 1864 that the cabins were build. Grant believed that while living in the tents that there still was a chance for capturing Petersburg before winter set in. Once cabins were built, he felt that the campaign would settle into a siege of Petersburg and the Confederate Army. General Grant is seated second from the left.

			<name>Explosion along wharf</name>
			<description><![CDATA[View looking north at a portion of the City Point wharf that was destroyed during the 9 August 1864 explosion set off by a homemade time-bomb, known at the time as a ""horological torpedo,"" created by Confederate spies and placed on an ammunition ship. As many as fifty-eight people were killed (mainly dock workers). When the bomb exploded it caused a chain reaction that included two barges and the storage building on the wharf, exploding 30,000 artillery shells and 75,000 small arms rounds. The wharf was quickly repaired and back into action within a few days. (Image: Library of Congress - 2012649545)
